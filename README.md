## Text Box Input
The classic way of using this is to just enter the text to be said into the text box and clicking the "Speak" Button

## Opens a Text Document
Do you want it to speak out a text document that you have on your computer? Just open it up and click the "Speak" Button

## Saves to Text Documents
If you have something you want it to say on multiple occasions, just save it!
